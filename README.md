**Project:** Design an HR Database

In this project, I was able to use SQL to design, build and populate a database for the Human Resources Department of Tech ABC Corp, a fictional video game company.

The goal of this project is to be able to digest a memo provided by the Tech ABC Corp Head of HR, with the business context of the company and requisition of a brand new HR database system, and come up with a solution proposal. It is essential to meet all the technical and business requirements of the project.
